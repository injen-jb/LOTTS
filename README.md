# Toward a Common Representation of Time Series Operations

This project is an initiative to engage a conversation between libraries editors in the Time Series open-source field and a set of professional developers, data scientists, data engineers...

The purpose of this conversation is to collectively reason about a *Common Representation of Time Series Operations*.

Project name: LOTTS, for *Lord Of The Time Series* (One framework specification to rule them all :sunglasses: !) 

[This happens here](https://github.com/injen-jb/LOTTS/wiki)
